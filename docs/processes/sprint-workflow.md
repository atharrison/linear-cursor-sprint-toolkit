# Sprint Workflow & Ceremonies

## Sprint Cadence

- **Sprint Length:** 2 weeks
- **Current Sprint:** [Update with your sprint start date]

---

## Ceremonies

### Daily Standup
- **When:** [Your standup time, e.g., 9:30am]
- **Duration:** 15 minutes max
- **Format:** 
  - **Monday–Thursday:** Live standup
  - **Friday:** Async via Slack (or customize)
  - What did you work on yesterday?
  - What are you working on today?
  - Any blockers?
- **Facilitation Notes:**
  - Keep it tight — detailed discussions happen offline
  - Actively identify and track blockers
  - Watch for scope creep signals in updates

### Pre-Planning (Before Sprint Kickoff)

Before the sprint planning meeting, ensure:
- [ ] Each team has tickets ready (pointed, scoped, AC's)
- [ ] Prioritized tickets identified for next cycle from refined backlog
- [ ] Team capacity assessed (vacations, other commitments)
- [ ] Product roadmap consulted, timeline issues surfaced
- [ ] Project documents, PRDs reviewed and updated as needed

**Note:** It's OK to leave time in sprint for creating engineering designs for upcoming work.

### Sprint Planning / Kickoff
- **When:** Monday morning (first day of sprint)
- **Duration:** 1 hour (ideally 15 min for kickoff review + 45 min detailed planning)
- **Kickoff Review (15 min):**
  - Review upcoming cycle with product and team
  - Understand priorities or changes in priority
  - Present engineering objectives — are they aligned with product?

### Backlog Grooming
- **When:** [Your grooming time, e.g., Bi-weekly]
- **Purpose:**
  - Review upcoming work
  - Refine scope and priorities
  - Prepare backlog for future cycles
- **Inputs:**
  - Prioritized backlog
  - Team capacity
  - Carryover from previous sprint
- **Outputs:**
  - Sprint goal
  - Committed sprint backlog
  - All tickets meet Definition of Ready

### Sprint Review / Demo
- **When:** [Your demo time, e.g., Final Friday of sprint]
- **Scope:** [Company-wide / Team / Stakeholders]
- **Purpose:** Demonstrate completed work to stakeholders

### Sprint Retrospective
- **When:** Monday or Tuesday following the cycle (scheduled ad hoc)
- **Duration:** 30-60 minutes
- **Format:** Three swimlanes:
  1. **What Went Well**
  2. **To Improve**
  3. **Action Items**
- **Rule:** Always end with at least one actionable item assigned to someone

## Work Breakdown Standards

> *"Too much work happening in one ticket" — common issue*

### Ticket Sizing Guidelines
- **Tool:** Linear
- **Estimation:** T-shirt sizing with target cycle times

| Size | Target Time | Notes |
|------|-------------|-------|
| **XS** | < 1 day | Quick fix, config change |
| **S** | 1 day | Small feature, simple bug |
| **M** | 2 days | Standard feature work |
| **L** | 4 days | Complex feature, multiple components |
| **XL** | 8 days | Large scope — consider breaking down |

- **Target:** Most tickets should be S or M
- **Max:** No ticket should exceed 1 week of work (XL)
- **If larger:** Break it down before pulling into sprint

### Definition of Ready (DoR)
*A ticket is ready for sprint when:*
- [ ] Clear acceptance criteria defined
- [ ] Dependencies identified and unblocked (or plan to unblock)
- [ ] Estimated by team
- [ ] Small enough to complete in sprint
- [ ] Technical approach understood (even if high-level)

### Definition of Done (DoD)

> **Key Question:** *"How are we delivering this?"*

*A ticket is done when:*
- [ ] Code complete and reviewed
- [ ] Tests written/passing
- [ ] Documentation updated (if applicable)
- [ ] **Deployed to Production and verified**
- [ ] Acceptance criteria verified
- [ ] Metrics/alerting established (for new features)

## SDLC Observations

> *"Challenge our current SDLC, identify bottlenecks"*

### Identified Bottlenecks
*Document observations as you identify them:*

| Bottleneck | Impact | Potential Solution | Status |
|------------|--------|-------------------|--------|
| *TBD* | *TBD* | *TBD* | Identified |

### Process Experiments
*Track process changes and their outcomes:*

| Change | Started | Outcome | Keep/Drop |
|--------|---------|---------|-----------|
